Laura,

- Congratulations on passing the judge Kattis!

- Good style!

However, 

- The comment in the header does not correctly describe the function of your
  program. It is obvious that it contains code, but... what does the code do? 

- Please read the style guidelines to make sure you understand them. Do not
  hesitate to ask any questions.


Peace,

- Dr. Rivas
